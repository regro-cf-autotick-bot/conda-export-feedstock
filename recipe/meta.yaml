  summary: 'Platform agnostic conda environment export'
  description: |
    An alternative to `conda env export` that helps create portable environment 
    specifications with minimum number of packages. 

    Conda-export creates environment specifications which contain only top-level 
    (non-transient) dependencies. It tries to minimize specific version information and 
    total number of packages, so that the resulting spec maximizes [upgradability](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-dependency-management/#three-kinds-of-dependency-specification).
    At the same time, it respects specific package versions that were used while creating 
    the environment. If, at some point, you installed a package with explicit version (e. g. 
    `conda install pytorch=1.9.0`), `conda-export` will include this specific version in 
    the resulting spec file.
